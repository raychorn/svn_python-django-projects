Design Notes:
    
    Template blobs consist of HTML with embedded {{ name }} references into which named templates are injected into.
    
    Pickle blobs consist of name,value pairs that define named pages of content.
    
    Pages of content are identified to the system as part of a URL such as the following:
    
    /page1/ that loads the Pickle Blob named "page1".
    
    Pickle Blobs reference a named Template Blob.
    
    A default Template is used when there is no named page as part of the URL.
    
    Pickle Blobs also name a parent page so that a Menu can be built for a site in an automated manner.
