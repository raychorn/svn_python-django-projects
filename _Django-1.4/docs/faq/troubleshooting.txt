This page contains some advice about errors and problems commonly encountered
during the development of Django applications.

"command not found: django-admin.py"
------------------------------------

:doc:`django-admin.py </ref/django-admin>` should be on your system path if you
installed Django via ``python setup.py``. If it's not on your path, you can
find it in ``site-packages/django/bin``, where ``site-packages`` is a directory
within your Python installation. Consider symlinking to :doc:`django-admin.py
</ref/django-admin>` from some place on your path, such as
:file:`/usr/local/bin`.
